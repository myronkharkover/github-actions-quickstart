# github-actions-quickstart

### Feedback-1
I found the documentation very accurate and easy to follow, and I was successfully able to set up the .yml file in the correct location. If I would add anything it would be more screenshots just for every step of the process, especially the creating the file in subfolders for those that have never used github before.
